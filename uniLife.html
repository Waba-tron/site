					Kicking off we have my foundation year. Now firstly I was never meant to attend a foundation year I was pretty much forced into doing it, as I didn't have the necessary subjects to take part in the subject. They wanted me to do a maths or science subject, which I obviously didn't have so that was a let down for me. But anyway my foundation was really chill, you hardly do anything not to mention the work was really easy at times. I met some nice people on the way and things were looking pretty good. That's until I got further into the year. Like I said you hardly do anything, which made my experience in foundation year really tedious, so you can imagine I was really happy that this year finally came to an end.

				</p>

					The work that they gave us was basic assignments which you could get done last minute. I remember submitting my maths and data analysis course literally 5hrs before it was due in, it was hilarious. That reminds those two subjects were the worst for me. I remember one time in my data analysis lab I was falling asleep and my teacher actually saw me falling asleep. Now a normal teacher would've banged the table and told me to wake up, but no this one just looked at me and carried on teaching, guess even he understood my struggles haha. Despite all this, somehow I still passed these units which is awesome!

					Probably the funniest thing that happened in this year, was the time I was helping my mate with his website portfolio, and one of the things you had to do was write the things you want to achieve after your foundation year and behind his back instead writing that, lets just say I wrote some explicit stuff on that part of the website. Luckily he checked it beforehand, otherwise, the teacher would be asking a lot of questions lol. The programming and website design units were quite fun, but it was really unfulfilling for me, I mean one of hardest things we were to make a palindrome function and the only CSS we did for our website was putting in two colors. But hey, at least I got hands dirty and started to code.
