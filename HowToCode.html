				<p>At this moment of time, I have only taken about 3 courses. One of which was a Java beginner course by Bryson Payne. The course was fun, taught me the basic fundamentals about programming such as Variables, loops all whilst making some cool good stuff.
				</p>

				<p>The course was laid out with three different projects, a guess the number 1 to 100 game, secret message, and a bubble draw app. Also for each of these projects, we made three different versions where we make a console, graphical user interface(GUI) and an Android app version. So the course was a bit repetitive in that sense. I haven't actually finished the course, but I felt I learned enough to start making my own projects.

				<p>One of my favourite courses when learning HTML5 and CCS3 is this one made by Jonas. Hes an awesome intructer and has taught me soo much when it make to web development and design.

				</p>

				<p>The course had its own biggner section where I learnt the basics of HTML5 and CSS3. After I completed that, I then went on to the next part of th course which was the website final project. In this I pretty much learnt everything there is to know about making a stunning website using HTML5 CSS3 and little bit of Jquery. I learnt how to structure a website clearly, add some responisveness with media queries and add some cool effects with JQ. After completing this course it then gave me the confidence to make this website your looking at now.
